# Codebreakers_2020_Writeup

This repository contains scripts and files associated with the NSA Codebreakers 2020 challenge. I was one of 6 people to complete this years challenge and have compiled a writeup about the solutions.

Some of the solutions don't go into the fine details and may gloss over some points, in these cases it is recommended to come to a better understanding yourself and figure out what may cause these to happen.

For any licensing referring to any binaries or files from the challenge itself refer to https://codebreaker.ltsnet.net/thanks.
